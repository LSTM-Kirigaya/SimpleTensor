# SimpleTensor
a simple demo to implement a deep learning frame based on static graph

Frame is implemented in `.\SimpleTensor\core.py`. You can even copy all the code directly given to its short code length.

It's `2021.2.18`, I haven't finished `Operation` of CNN, RNN and transformer, which might make some audience disappointed. Fine, give me a chance and I will implement the lovely API after I finish my second track of my album :D

I am going to presenting how the cake is baked instead of being going to tell you how to use it.
